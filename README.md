# Description
We demonstrate the application of harmonic-balance analysis in modeling the circuit dynamics of electro-neural interfaces, which is fully described in paper [Harmonic-Balance Circuit Analysis for Electro-Neural Interfaces](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.17.910968). The code is in MATLAB, and uses sample data from experiments that closely imitate the dynamics of [photovoltaic retinal prosthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_retinal_prosthesis).

# How to Run
Simply open script /HBA_demo.m in MATLAB and run (Optimization toolbox required). The code was developed with MATLAB R2017a and might experience compatibility issue with earlier/later versions. See inline documentation for detailed explanation of the code. The authors expect the following figure upon the completion of the script -
